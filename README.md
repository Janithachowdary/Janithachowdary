The objective is to develop an algorithm that can accurately detect occurrences 
of a specific object, represented in image A, within a larger image B. The 
algorithm should be able to analyse the features of the object in image A and 
compare them with the features of the objects in image B to identify and 
localize all occurrences of the object within image B. The goal is to achieve 
high accuracy and robustness in detecting the object in different settings and 
under various conditions, such as changes in lighting, scale, rotation, and 
occlusion. scalable to handle large-scale datasets in real-time applications.
